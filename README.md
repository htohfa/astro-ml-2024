Predicting time series
- develop 3 approaches for predicting the next point in a time series, the next 3 points, the next 10 points (with uncertainties if the algorithm supports this)
- the initial approach should use Gaussian Processes as a starting point
- one of the approaches should use a neural network approach
- compare the performance for each of the data sets

We are using 4 different Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series data to predict next points in the time series. The datasets get progresively challanging as we have fewer data points and less deterministic analytical model. We are using Gaussian process, curve fit and neural network for predicting our time series data.
